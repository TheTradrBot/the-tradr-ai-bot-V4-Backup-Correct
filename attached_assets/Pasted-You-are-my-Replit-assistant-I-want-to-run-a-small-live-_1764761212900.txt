You are my Replit assistant. I want to run a small live/demo check to confirm whether my trading bot, when connected to a 5ers MT5 account, produces the same trades as my historical backtest using the same strategy and parameters. Do not start until I provide the MT5 demo credentials and the exact strategy name + parameters. Follow these steps exactly and produce logs and a comparison report.

Connect to MT5:

Use MT5 Python API (MetaTrader5) and connect to the provided MT5 demo server credentials (account, password, server).

Verify connection (account info, server time, symbol list).

Map symbol names: confirm the exact symbol string used by the broker (e.g. EURUSD vs EURUSD.a) and record tick/quote precision.

Environment sync:

Confirm platform timezone/UTC offset and note server time.

Query and record current spread, commission, swap, and minimum lot size for each test symbol.

Strategy load:

Load the specified strategy code / EA or call the exact entry/exit logic from the repo.

Ensure indicators/settings match the backtest version (same indicator code, period, smoothing, source price). If any indicator code differs, log the difference and stop.

Micro test plan:

Run the strategy in demo/live (not paper) on a single symbol for a small, time-boxed test. Two options — pick one:
A) Run until N trades execute (e.g., N = 5) OR
B) Run for T minutes/hours (e.g., T = 120 minutes).

Use the same lot sizing / position sizing rules as the backtest.

When placing orders, log every event with: timestamp (server UTC), symbol, order type, requested price, executed price, executed volume, spread at execution, slippage (executed - requested), order fill time (ms), order id, reason (open / modify / close), account balance & margin after trade.

Data logging & storage:

Save all logs (CSV and JSON) to /mnt/data/replit_test_logs with filenames containing timestamp.

Also snapshot a chart image around each entry/exit using the broker tick data (if available) or the last 1000 bars from MT5 for the symbol/timeframe and save to /mnt/data/plots.

Backtest comparison:

Load backtest trades (user will provide backtest CSV or the assistant will generate from local repo backtest results). Backtest log must include: timestamp, entry price, exit price, order type, size, and strategy parameters.

Normalize timestamps to UTC and symbol names to broker's naming convention.

For each live trade match with the corresponding backtest trade by trade index or by nearest timestamp within a tolerance (e.g., 5 min). Compare:
• Entry price difference (pips)
• Exit price difference (pips)
• Spread difference at entry & exit
• Slippage recorded
• Execution delay (ms)
• Result differences (PnL in account currency and R)

Produce a summary: exact-match count, near-match count, mismatches (and reasons).

Report:

Produce a human-readable report (Markdown) containing:
• Test parameters and environment (server, spread, timezone)
• Complete CSV of live trades and backtest trades used
• Comparison table of the N most important trades (showing differences)
• Root causes for differences (if detectable): spread, slippage, different tick data, broker execution model, order type mismatch, GMT offset, symbol suffix/prefix, partial fills, stops being triggered by intrabar ticks, or trade sizing rounding.
• Recommendation list to reduce differences (e.g., use tick-by-tick backtest data from the broker, set limit instead of market orders, widen stop margins, use same spread profile in backtest).

Pass/fail criteria:

Suggest pass/fail thresholds (editable):
• Pass if ≥ 80% of trades have entry price difference ≤ X pips and result difference ≤ Y% (default X = 1.0 pip, Y = 5%).
• Otherwise fail and list prioritized fixes.

Safety & cleanup:

Use a demo account by default. If user supplies a funded live account, require explicit confirmation to trade real money.

After the test, close any opened positions unless user instructs otherwise, and produce a final account snapshot.

Deliverables (files + console):

/mnt/data/replit_test_logs/test_<timestamp>_live_trades.csv

/mnt/data/replit_test_logs/test_<timestamp>_backtest_trades.csv

/mnt/data/replit_test_logs/comparison_report_<timestamp>.md

PNG snapshots of charts for entries/exits.

Console summary with top 5 differences.

When you are ready, ask me for the following inputs (in a single turn): MT5 server name, account number, password, symbol(s) to test, strategy identifier (file path in repo), exact strategy parameters, test mode (N trades or T minutes), and backtest CSV or backtest file path. Then perform the test and return the files and a markdown report.
