\# Blueprint HTF Confluence Strategy – Spec (v2, updated TPs)

\#\# 1\. High-level overview

\#\#\# 1.1 Type of trader & holding period

\* Trades are based on \*\*Daily frameworks\*\* with 4H entry level and Monthly/Weekly for confluence.  
\* Typical holding time: \*\*multiple days up to \~1–2 weeks\*\*, not intraday scalping and not multi-month investing.

\#\#\# 1.2 Markets

The framework is generic and can be applied to:

\* \*\*FX\*\* (primary focus, examples: EURCHF, AUDCAD, majors, crosses).  
\* \*\*Commodities\*\*.  
\* \*\*Indices\*\*.  
\* \*\*Crypto\*\*.

Requirements for instruments:

\* Clean technical behaviour (respects HTF levels and structure).

\#\#\# 1.3 Core tools & concepts

The strategy is built from these components:

\* \*\*Support & Resistance (S/R)\*\*:  
  \* High-timeframe horizontal levels (mainly \*\*Monthly\*\* and \*\*Weekly\*\*).  
  \* Used as anchor points for bias, entries and targets.

\* \*\*Market Structure\*\*:  
  \* HH/HL vs LH/LL, \*\*break of structure (BOS)\*\* and \*\*change of character (CHOCH)\*\*.  
  \* \*\*Breakaway candles\*\* are crucial for confirming structure shifts.

\* \*\*Fibonacci\*\*:  
  \* Retracement levels: \*\*0.618, 0.66, 0.796\*\*.  
  \* Extension levels (for targets / TPs):  
    \* \*\*TP1\*\* → \*\*−0.25\*\*  
    \* \*\*TP2\*\* → \*\*−0.68\*\*  
    \* \*\*TP3\*\* → \*\*−1.00\*\*  
    \* \*\*TP4\*\* → \*\*−1.42\*\*  
    \* \*\*TP5\*\* → \*\*−2.00\*\*  
  \* Used to frame pullbacks into zones and set structured TP ladders.

\* \*\*Structural Frameworks\*\*:  
  \* \*\*Head & Shoulders\*\* (H\&S).  
  \* \*\*Inverse Head & Shoulders\*\*.  
  \* \*\*Bullish N pattern\*\* (continuation).  
  \* \*\*Bearish V pattern\*\* (continuation).  
  \* Used to structure entries and manage trades around HTF levels.

\* \*\*Supply & Demand / Order Blocks\*\*:  
  \* Last opposing candle/cluster before strong displacement that breaks structure.  
  \* Serve as refined entry zones within HTF S/R.

\* \*\*Liquidity & Magnetic Price Levels\*\*:  
  \* Equal highs/lows, previous day/week/month highs and lows, key swing points.  
  \* Price is “drawn” toward these pools and often reverses after taking them.

\* \*\*Top-down HTF Confluence\*\*:  
  \* Monthly → Weekly → Daily for bias.  
  \* 4H only for \*\*entry confirmation & precise execution\*\*.

The system is a \*\*confluence-based HTF swing framework\*\*: entries only occur when \*\*HTF bias\*\*, \*\*structure\*\*, \*\*S/R\*\*, \*\*zones\*\*, \*\*Fibonacci\*\* and \*\*liquidity\*\* line up, with \*\*4H confirmation\*\*.

\---

\#\# 2\. Timeframes & top-down confluence

\#\#\# 2.1 Timeframe stack

\* \*\*Monthly (MN)\*\*:  
  \* Draw major \*\*S/R\*\* and observe very large swing highs/lows and equal highs/lows.  
  \* Identify \*\*macro trend\*\* (decade-scale) and biggest liquidity magnets.

\* \*\*Weekly (W1)\*\*:  
  \* Primary trend timeframe.  
  \* Draw \*\*weekly S/R\*\* that align with monthly levels.  
  \* Identify \*\*weekly structural frameworks\*\*:  
    \* H\&S / inverse H\&S.  
    \* Bullish N / Bearish V.  
  \* Define \*\*core trading bias\*\* for coming weeks.

\* \*\*Daily (D1)\*\*:  
  \* Execution-bias timeframe.  
  \* Refine location within the weekly swing:  
    \* Are we in an \*\*impulse leg\*\* or a \*\*correction\*\*?  
  \* Map \*\*daily supply/demand (order blocks)\*\* and local S/R.  
  \* Identify liquidity pools (equal highs/lows, prior day’s levels).

\* \*\*4H (H4)\*\*:  
  \* \*\*Entry confirmation ONLY.\*\*  
  \* Used to:  
    \* Confirm CHOCH/BOS in direction of HTF idea.  
    \* Define precise demand/supply zone for entries.  
    \* Refine stop placement & intraday liquidity grabs.

\#\#\# 2.2 HTF bias definition

Bias is defined \*\*top-down\*\*:

1\. \*\*Monthly macro context\*\*  
   \* Look at last \*\*3–5 swings\*\*:  
     \* Sequence of \*\*HH/HL → macro uptrend\*\*.  
     \* Sequence of \*\*LH/LL → macro downtrend\*\*.  
   \* Note:  
     \* Are we near a \*\*major monthly S/R or order block\*\*?  
     \* Are we approaching or just rejecting a major \*\*liquidity pool\*\* (e.g. equal highs/lows)?

2\. \*\*Weekly primary bias\*\*  
   \* Weekly is \*\*the main bias timeframe\*\*.  
   \* Identify:  
     \* Current structure (HH/HL or LH/LL).  
     \* Latest \*\*BOS\*\* with a clear \*\*breakaway candle\*\*.  
     \* Presence of weekly \*\*reversal frameworks\*\* (H\&S or inverse H\&S).  
   \* Rules:  
     \* \*\*Bullish bias\*\* if:  
       \* Clear HH/HL structure AND  
       \* last BOS is \*\*up\*\* with a strong breakaway candle, AND  
       \* price is above the last \*\*key higher low\*\* (key HL).  
     \* \*\*Bearish bias\*\* if:  
       \* Clear LH/LL structure AND  
       \* last BOS is \*\*down\*\* with breakaway candle, AND  
       \* price is below the last \*\*key lower high\*\* (key LH).  
     \* \*\*Neutral / cautious\*\* if:  
       \* Weekly is choppy around key S/R, or  
       \* recent BOS is unclear or quickly reversed (deviation).

3\. \*\*Daily execution bias\*\*  
   \* Use D1 to refine entries \*\*within weekly bias\*\*:  
     \* In a \*\*weekly uptrend\*\*, daily can:  
       \* Be in impulse → no fresh long until a pullback.  
       \* Be in retracement → we look for long setups at daily demand / HTF S/R \+ fib confluence.  
     \* In a \*\*weekly downtrend\*\*, inverse logic for shorts.  
   \* Daily CHOCH against weekly trend can signal:  
     \* A potential deeper pullback into HTF demand/supply.  
     \* Or the early stage of a weekly reversal if at major HTF level \+ framework.

\#\#\# 2.3 When \*\*not\*\* to trade

Do \*\*not\*\* take trades when:

\* \*\*Conflicting bias\*\*:  
  \* Weekly is bullish, but daily is strongly bearish and \*\*not at a major HTF level / framework\*\*.  
  \* Weekly is bearish, but daily strongly bullish without confluence.

\* \*\*Chop / mid-range\*\*:  
  \* Price is in the \*\*middle\*\* of a broad Monthly/Weekly range with:  
    \* No nearby HTF S/R.  
    \* No clear supply/demand zone.  
    \* No clear liquidity magnet above/below.

\* \*\*After exhausting moves\*\*:  
  \* Price has already hit major \*\*extension targets\*\* (e.g. −1.00 or −1.42 / −2.00) and left \*\*no clean pullback zones\*\*.

\* \*\*No 4H confirmation\*\*:  
  \* Even if HTF looks good, do not enter if the 4H fails to:  
    \* Sweep liquidity or tap zone, then  
    \* Provide CHOCH/BOS or acceptable candle confirmation.

\---

\#\# 3\. Support / Resistance (S/R) methodology

\#\#\# 3.1 Rules for drawing S/R

\*\*Primary: Monthly chart\*\*

1\. Start from the \*\*far left\*\* of the chart.  
2\. Use a \*\*horizontal line\*\* and look for price levels where:  
   \* Price \*\*repeatedly bounced or rejected\*\* (3+ “taps”).  
   \* The level acted as \*\*both support and resistance\*\* at different times (flip).  
3\. Prioritise \*\*wick extremes\*\*, but adjust so that:  
   \* The line captures the \*\*cluster\*\* of reactions.  
   \* If wicks are messy, use the \*\*bodies\*\* that best represent the zone.

\*\*Supplementary: Weekly chart\*\*

4\. On W1, refine around monthly levels:  
   \* Add \*\*at most a few additional lines\*\* near current price:  
     \* With multiple taps.  
     \* Where weekly candles show \*\*strong rejection wicks\*\* or big reactions.

\*\*Optional: Daily\*\*

5\. Only add daily S/R if:  
   \* It is clearly respected.  
   \* It aligns with fib / liquidity and sits \*\*inside\*\* a higher-timeframe zone.  
   \* It will be used to refine entries, not to define primary bias.

\#\#\# 3.2 Wicks vs bodies

\* \*\*Liquidity & extremes\*\*:  
  \* Use \*\*wicks\*\* to understand where stops and liquidity sit.  
\* \*\*Key S/R level\*\*:  
  \* Place the main line where \*\*most bodies and wicks cluster\*\*.  
  \* Think in \*\*zones\*\*, not razor-thin lines:  
    \* Treat ±0.1–0.3% around the line (depending on asset) as part of the S/R \*\*zone\*\*.

\#\#\# 3.3 Strength of levels

\* \*\*Strong S/R (Tier 1)\*\*:  
  \* Monthly level.  
  \* At least \*\*4–5 taps\*\* over multiple years.  
  \* Acts both as support and resistance.  
  \* Associated with \*\*impulsive moves\*\* away from the level.

\* \*\*Medium S/R (Tier 2)\*\*:  
  \* Monthly or weekly level.  
  \* 2–4 taps.  
  \* May be used for entries if confluence with supply/demand \+ fib \+ liquidity.

\* \*\*Local S/R (Tier 3)\*\*:  
  \* Daily level.  
  \* Used for \*\*fine-tuning entries or stops\*\* inside a higher zone.  
  \* Not sufficient by itself for bias or standalone trades.

\#\#\# 3.4 Interaction with other components

\* \*\*Market Structure\*\*:  
  \* BOS/CHOCH around a Tier 1 or Tier 2 S/R carries \*\*more weight\*\*.  
  \* Deviation (wick through S/R, close back inside) is often a \*\*liquidity grab\*\*.

\* \*\*Structural Frameworks\*\*:  
  \* H\&S, inverse H\&S, Bullish N, Bearish V should \*\*ideally form at or near Tier 1–2 S/R\*\*.

\* \*\*Supply & Demand\*\*:  
  \* Often, supply/demand zones are nested around S/R:  
    \* E.g. last bearish candle just below a resistance level → \*\*supply zone\*\*.  
  \* S/R gives \*\*horizontal anchor\*\*; supply/demand gives \*\*zone width\*\*.

\* \*\*Liquidity levels\*\*:  
  \* Equal highs/lows often form \*\*just above/below S/R\*\*.  
  \* Magnetic behaviour: price runs to the \*\*liquidity beyond the S/R\*\* then often reverses.

\---

\#\# 4\. Market Structure rules

\#\#\# 4.1 Definitions

\* \*\*Swing high\*\*:  
  \* A high with at least \*\*one lower high to the left and right\*\* (on that timeframe).

\* \*\*Swing low\*\*:  
  \* A low with at least one \*\*higher low to the left and right\*\*.

\* \*\*Higher High (HH)\*\*:  
  \* Current swing high \> previous swing high.

\* \*\*Higher Low (HL)\*\*:  
  \* Current swing low \> previous swing low.

\* \*\*Lower High (LH)\*\*:  
  \* Current swing high \< previous swing high.

\* \*\*Lower Low (LL)\*\*:  
  \* Current swing low \< previous swing low.

\* \*\*Break of Structure (BOS)\*\*:  
  \* A \*\*candle close (body)\*\* that \*\*decisively breaks\*\* a prior significant swing high/low \*\*in the direction of the trend\*\*.  
  \* Ideally via a \*\*“breakaway candle”\*\*:  
    \* Large real body.  
    \* Closes beyond the level, not just wicking through.

\* \*\*Change of Character (CHOCH)\*\*:  
  \* First \*\*BOS against\*\* the prevailing trend:  
    \* In an uptrend (HH/HL), a break \*\*below\*\* the last HL.  
    \* In a downtrend (LH/LL), a break \*\*above\*\* the last LH.  
  \* Sign of potential \*\*trend reversal or deeper correction\*\*.

\#\#\# 4.2 Tracking structure by timeframe

\* \*\*Daily\*\*:  
  \* This is where we primarily \*\*track swing structure\*\* for trades.  
  \* Identify:  
    \* Last \*\*key HL or LH\*\* that defines trend.  
    \* Recent BOS/CHOCH.  
    \* Whether current leg is \*\*impulse\*\* or \*\*correction\*\*.

\* \*\*4H\*\*:  
  \* Used to refine daily view:  
    \* Look for \*\*mini BOS/CHOCH\*\* inside HTF zones.  
    \* Structure breaks on 4H showing \*\*participation in direction\*\* of HTF bias.

\#\#\# 4.3 Determining trend and bias

On \*\*Daily\*\*:

\* \*\*Uptrend\*\*:  
  \* At least two \*\*HH/HL sequences\*\*.  
  \* No recent daily BOS to the downside.  
  \* Last key HL is intact.

\* \*\*Downtrend\*\*:  
  \* At least two \*\*LH/LL sequences\*\*.  
  \* No recent BOS up.  
  \* Last key LH is intact.

\* \*\*Range / transition\*\*:  
  \* Equal highs/lows.  
  \* Alternating BOS both directions.  
  \* Often corresponds to \*\*formation of H\&S / inverse H\&S\*\* or accumulation/distribution.

\#\#\# 4.4 Combination with S/R, supply/demand, liquidity

\* \*\*At HTF support\*\* (Monthly/Weekly S/R \+ demand):  
  \* Look for \*\*downtrend losing power\*\*:  
    \* Failure to create new LL near support.  
    \* CHOCH or BOS up.  
    \* Inverse H\&S, Bullish N forming.  
  \* Liquidity behaviour:  
    \* Sweeps \*\*equal lows / previous lows\*\* then strong rejection.

\* \*\*At HTF resistance\*\* (S/R \+ supply):  
  \* Look for \*\*uptrend losing power\*\*:  
    \* Failure to make new HH.  
    \* CHOCH or BOS down.  
    \* H\&S, Bearish V forming.  
  \* Liquidity behaviour:  
    \* Sweeps \*\*equal highs / previous highs\*\* then rejection.

\* \*\*Structural Frameworks\*\*:  
  \* BOS that \*\*completes\*\* or \*\*confirms\*\* a framework (e.g. break of neckline of H\&S) is a \*\*higher-probability signal\*\* than isolated BOS.

\---

\#\# 5\. Supply & Demand zones

\#\#\# 5.1 Definitions

\* \*\*Demand zone (bullish order block)\*\*:  
  \* The last \*\*bearish candle or cluster\*\* before a \*\*strong impulsive move up\*\* that:  
    \* Breaks structure (BOS).  
    \* Or at least takes significant liquidity (sweeps lows).  
  \* Zone boundaries:  
    \* From the \*\*open of the last bearish candle\*\* down to its \*\*lowest wick\*\*.  
    \* Optionally expanded slightly to include neighbouring small candles of the same base.

\* \*\*Supply zone (bearish order block)\*\*:  
  \* The last \*\*bullish candle or cluster\*\* before a strong \*\*impulsive move down\*\* that:  
    \* Breaks structure.  
    \* Or sweeps equal highs.

\#\#\# 5.2 Criteria for valid zones

A zone is \*\*valid\*\* if:

1\. The move away from the zone is \*\*impulsive\*\*:  
   \* Large candle bodies, minimal overlap.  
   \* Preferably a \*\*breakaway candle\*\*.  
2\. That move causes at least one of:  
   \* A \*\*BOS\*\* on that timeframe or higher.  
   \* Clear \*\*liquidity grab\*\* (taking equal highs/lows, previous day/week high/low).  
3\. The zone is located near:  
   \* A \*\*HTF S/R level\*\*, and/or  
   \* A \*\*Fibonacci retracement\*\* of a key swing.

\#\#\# 5.3 Fresh vs used zones

\* \*\*Fresh zone\*\*:  
  \* Price has \*\*not returned\*\* to the zone since the impulsive move away.  
  \* Highest-probability reaction.

\* \*\*First retest\*\*:  
  \* First time price revisits the zone.  
  \* Still high probability; often where we \*\*plan entries\*\*.

\* \*\*Used / degraded zone\*\*:  
  \* Zone has been tapped multiple times.  
  \* Each additional tap reduces its reliability.  
  \* After 2–3 deep tests, zone is considered \*\*lower priority\*\* or invalid.

\#\#\# 5.4 Invalidation

A supply/demand zone is \*\*invalidated\*\* if:

\* Price \*\*closes decisively beyond\*\* the opposite edge of the zone on its defining timeframe (e.g. daily close beyond daily zone).  
\* The zone is \*\*fully traded through\*\* with no significant reaction (slow grind, overlapping candles).  
\* A new, stronger zone and structure is formed \*\*inside or beyond\*\* it, making the old one obsolete.

\#\#\# 5.5 Relationship with HTF S/R & market structure

\* Zones inside or overlapping \*\*Monthly/Weekly S/R\*\* are \*\*priority\*\*.  
\* In trend:  
  \* Uptrend: buy from \*\*demand\*\* at or near \*\*support\*\*.  
  \* Downtrend: sell from \*\*supply\*\* at or near \*\*resistance\*\*.  
\* Around \*\*BOS/CHOCH\*\*:  
  \* After a BOS, the \*\*origin OB\*\* is often used for the \*\*pullback entry\*\*.  
  \* After CHOCH at HTF level, a new OB forms to initiate the fresh trend.

\#\#\# 5.6 Use in entries, stops, targets

\* \*\*Entries\*\*:  
  \* Look to enter \*\*inside the demand/supply zone\*\*, ideally:  
    \* At \*\*Fibonacci golden pocket\*\* (0.618–0.796).  
    \* After a \*\*liquidity sweep\*\* into the zone (wick through, close back in).  
    \* With \*\*4H confirmation\*\* (BOS/CHOCH or strong candle).

\* \*\*Stops\*\*:  
  \* Placed \*\*beyond the far edge\*\* of the zone:  
    \* Long: below the lowest wick of demand.  
    \* Short: above highest wick of supply.  
  \* Optionally a bit further \*\*beyond obvious liquidity\*\* (equal lows/highs) to avoid easy stop hunts.

\* \*\*Targets\*\*:  
  \* Next \*\*opposing zones\*\* and/or \*\*liquidity pools\*\*:  
    \* Long from demand → next HTF \*\*supply\*\* or prior structural high.  
    \* Short from supply → next HTF \*\*demand\*\* or prior structural low.  
  \* Fibs: use \*\*extension levels\*\* as TP bands:  
    \* First band around \*\*−0.25\*\*,  
    \* Then \*\*−0.68\*\*,  
    \* Then \*\*−1.00\*\*, \*\*−1.42\*\*, and \*\*−2.00\*\* for extended trends.

\---

\#\# 6\. Structural Frameworks

From the Structural Frameworks lesson, the main patterns:

\#\#\# 6.1 Head & Shoulders (H\&S) – bearish reversal

\*\*Structure & formation\*\*

\* Occurs after an \*\*uptrend\*\*.  
\* Components:  
  \* Left shoulder: a swing high.  
  \* Head: higher swing high.  
  \* Right shoulder: swing high similar in height to left shoulder but \*\*fails\*\* to make a new HH.  
  \* Neckline: support connecting the two swing lows between shoulders and head.

\*\*Confirmation\*\*

\* Break of the \*\*neckline\*\* with a \*\*bearish breakaway candle\*\* (BOS down).  
\* Ideally occurs at or just beyond \*\*HTF resistance / supply\*\*.

\*\*Entries\*\*

\* Conservative:  
  \* On the \*\*pullback to the neckline\*\* or retest of \*\*supply/OB\*\* forming the right shoulder.  
\* Aggressive:  
  \* Near completion of right shoulder if:  
    \* Liquidity has just been swept above the head/shoulder highs.  
    \* 4H shows bearish CHOCH/BOS.

\*\*Stops\*\*

\* Above the \*\*right shoulder high\*\* or head (depending on aggressiveness).  
\* If at extreme HTF level, above the \*\*liquidity highs\*\* you expect to be swept.

\*\*Targets\*\*

\* First target: prior \*\*swing low\*\* or \*\*demand zone\*\*.  
\* Secondary targets: \*\*Fib extensions\*\*:  
  \* \*\*−0.25\*\* as first major target,  
  \* then \*\*−0.68\*\*, \*\*−1.00\*\*, \*\*−1.42\*\*, and \*\*−2.00\*\* if weekly confirms full reversal.

\*\*Alignment\*\*

\* S/R: Monthly/Weekly resistance.  
\* Supply: H\&S shoulder/neckline OB.  
\* Structure: Daily BOS down breaking neckline.  
\* Fib: optional retracement/extension confluence.  
\* Liquidity: Head sweep of external highs; entry after internal liquidity sweep on 4H.  
\* 4H: Provides actual trigger.

\---

\#\#\# 6.2 Inverse Head & Shoulders – bullish reversal

Mirror of H\&S.

\*\*Structure\*\*

\* Occurs after a \*\*downtrend\*\* at HTF support/demand.  
\* Left shoulder low → deeper head low → right shoulder higher low, failing to print a new LL.

\*\*Confirmation\*\*

\* Break \*\*above neckline\*\* with bullish breakaway candle (BOS up).

\*\*Entries\*\*

\* Buy on \*\*retest of neckline\*\* / daily demand zone / golden pocket.  
\* 4H should show:  
  \* Liquidity sweep below shoulder/head lows.  
  \* Bullish CHOCH/BOS.

\*\*Stops\*\*

\* Below the \*\*right shoulder low\*\* or head low (more conservative).  
\* Ideally beyond the main \*\*liquidity pool\*\* that was swept.

\*\*Targets\*\*

\* Prior swing highs and opposing supply zones.  
\* \*\*Fib extensions\*\*:  
  \* \*\*−0.25\*\* as first major target,  
  \* then \*\*−0.68\*\*, \*\*−1.00\*\*, \*\*−1.42\*\*, and \*\*−2.00\*\* in strong reversals.

\*\*Alignment\*\*

\* S/R: Monthly/Weekly support.  
\* Demand: OB at right shoulder.  
\* Structure: Daily BOS up across neckline.  
\* Fib: Golden pocket pullback to demand \+ extension mapping.  
\* Liquidity: Head sweeps external lows; 4H sweeps internal lows.  
\* 4H: Confirmation for entry.

\---

\#\#\# 6.3 Bullish N pattern – continuation

\*\*Structure\*\*

\* Three main legs forming an “N”:  
  1\. \*\*Impulse up\*\* (leg 1): move with breakaway candle, BOS up.  
  2\. \*\*Correction down\*\* (leg 2): controlled pullback, respecting HL structure.  
  3\. \*\*Impulse up\*\* (leg 3): new HH continuation.

\*\*Formation rules\*\*

\* Leg 1 starts from a \*\*demand zone \+ HTF support\*\* or after inverse H\&S.  
\* Leg 2:  
  \* Retraces into \*\*golden pocket (0.618–0.796)\*\* of leg 1\.  
  \* Ideally taps or just overshoots the \*\*origin OB\*\*.  
\* Leg 3:  
  \* Launches with a bullish breakaway candle.  
  \* Aims for Fib \*\*extensions in sequence: −0.25 → −0.68 → −1.00 → −1.42 → −2.00\*\*, depending on trend strength.

\*\*Entries\*\*

\* During leg 2:  
  \* At \*\*demand\*\* \+ fib confluence.  
  \* With 4H confirming a \*\*local CHOCH/BOS up\*\* (after sweeping local lows).

\*\*Stops\*\*

\* Below the \*\*swing low of leg 2\*\* / base of demand zone.

\*\*Targets\*\*

\* New HH beyond leg 1 high.  
\* Use extension ladder: −0.25 first, then −0.68, etc., depending on conditions.

\---

\#\#\# 6.4 Bearish V pattern – continuation

\*\*Structure\*\*

\* Mirror of Bullish N but in downtrend:  
  1\. Impulse down (breakaway candle, BOS down).  
  2\. Controlled correction up into supply.  
  3\. Impulse down continuation.

\*\*Entries\*\*

\* During leg 2:  
  \* At \*\*supply\*\* that aligns with \*\*golden pocket\*\* of leg 1\.  
  \* Liquidity sweep above local highs.  
  \* 4H bearish CHOCH/BOS.

\*\*Stops\*\*

\* Above swing high of leg 2 / supply high.

\*\*Targets\*\*

\* New LL beyond leg 1 low.  
\* Fib extension ladder:  
  \* First around \*\*−0.25\*\*,  
  \* then \*\*−0.68\*\*, \*\*−1.00\*\*, \*\*−1.42\*\*, \*\*−2.00\*\* if trend is very strong.

\---

\#\#\# 6.5 Interaction with other components

Structural frameworks must \*\*align with\*\*:

\#\# 7\. Fibonacci rules

\#\#\# 7.1 Swing selection

\* Use Fibs \*\*only on meaningful swings\*\*:  
  \* Swings with \*\*breakaway candles\*\* and \*\*BOS\*\* or clear liquidity grab.  
\* General rule:  
  \* In an \*\*uptrend\*\*:  
    \* Draw \*\*from swing low (body) to swing high (wick)\*\* of the impulsive leg.  
  \* In a \*\*downtrend\*\*:  
    \* Draw from \*\*swing high (body) to swing low (wick)\*\*.

\#\#\# 7.2 Key Fibonacci levels

Configured levels:

\* \*\*Retracements\*\*:  
  \* \*\*0.618\*\* – classic golden pocket start.  
  \* \*\*0.66\*\* – refined golden area.  
  \* \*\*0.796 (≈ 0.786)\*\* – deep retracement, often in strong trends.

\* \*\*Extensions\*\* (for targets / TP ladder):  
  \* \*\*−0.25\*\* – TP1, conservative extension.  
  \* \*\*−0.68\*\* – TP2, stronger continuation.  
  \* \*\*−1.00\*\* – TP3, solid trend extension.  
  \* \*\*−1.42\*\* – TP4, extended trend / exhaustion area.  
  \* \*\*−2.00\*\* – TP5, maximum/overshoot extension zone.

\#\#\# 7.3 Confluence usage

Fibs are never used alone; they \*\*confluence\*\* with:

\* \*\*S/R zones\*\*:  
  \* Alignment of golden pocket with \*\*Monthly/Weekly S/R\*\* is a \*\*high-signal area\*\*.

\* \*\*Supply & Demand\*\*:  
  \* Golden pocket overlapping with \*\*fresh OB\*\* is a prime entry region.

\* \*\*Structural Frameworks\*\*:  
  \* Leg retracement of H\&S / N / V patterns often ends at the golden pocket.

\* \*\*Liquidity\*\*:  
  \* Best entries: \*\*liquidity sweep into golden pocket\*\* (e.g., equal lows taken, wick into 0.618–0.796, close back inside).

\* \*\*HTF bias\*\*:  
  \* Only take golden-pocket entries \*\*in direction of HTF bias\*\*:  
    \* Uptrend → buy retracements.  
    \* Downtrend → sell retracements.

\#\#\# 7.4 Example rule

\* \*\*Uptrend example\*\*:  
  \* Weekly and daily bullish.  
  \* Identify an impulsive daily leg that caused BOS.  
  \* Draw Fib from \*\*body of last key HL\*\* to \*\*wick of new HH\*\*.  
  \* Wait for price to:  
    \* Retrace into \*\*0.618–0.796\*\*.  
    \* Tap \*\*daily demand\*\* / OB inside the zone.  
    \* Show \*\*4H bullish CHOCH/BOS\*\* after sweeping local lows.  
  \* Enter long, stop below \*\*swing low\*\* or OB wick.  
  \* Use extension ladder for TPs: \*\*−0.25, then −0.68, then −1.00, −1.42, −2.00\*\* if trend remains strong.

\#\# 8\. Liquidity: magnetic price levels

\#\#\# 8.1 Definition

“\*\*Magnetic price levels\*\*” are price areas that \*\*attract price\*\* because they contain \*\*clusters of stop orders\*\* and \*\*resting liquidity\*\*, such as:

\* \*\*Swing highs and lows\*\*.  
\* \*\*Equal highs / equal lows\*\* (relative or perfect).  
\* \*\*Previous month / week / day highs and lows\*\*.  
\* \*\*Major S/R levels\*\*.  
\* Sometimes edges of \*\*gaps / fair value gaps\*\* and large OBs.

Price tends to \*\*travel towards\*\* these magnets, fill orders, and then often \*\*reverse\*\* or accelerate.

\#\#\# 8.2 Why price is attracted

\* Market makers/algos seek areas where they can \*\*fill large orders\*\*.  
\* Stops above highs / below lows create \*\*liquidity pools\*\*.  
\* Once price approaches, it:  
  \* Often \*\*spikes through\*\* the level (liquidity grab).  
  \* Then either:  
    \* Reverses (sweep \+ reversal), or  
    \* Continues if higher-timeframe trend remains strong.

\#\#\# 8.3 Identification rules

On HTF (Monthly/Weekly/Daily):

\* Mark:  
  \* Major swing highs and lows.  
  \* \*\*Equal highs / lows\*\*:  
    \* Two or more highs/lows at similar price (within a small tolerance).  
  \* \*\*Previous period highs/lows\*\*:  
    \* Previous month high/low.  
    \* Previous week high/low.  
    \* Previous day high/low (on Daily/4H for finer detail).

On LTF (4H):

\* Refine:  
  \* Local equal highs/lows inside the larger swing.  
  \* Session highs/lows if available.  
  \* Micro internal liquidity inside HTF zones.

\#\#\# 8.4 Internal vs external liquidity

Define:

\* \*\*External liquidity\*\*:  
  \* Liquidity beyond the \*\*current main range\*\*.  
  \* Example: the bigger swing high/low that defines the current structure.  
  \* Taking external liquidity often signals \*\*major reversals\*\*.

\* \*\*Internal liquidity\*\*:  
  \* Liquidity \*\*inside\*\* the current range:  
    \* intra-range equal highs/lows.  
    \* small swing points between main extremes.  
  \* Often used during trend to \*\*fuel continuation\*\*.

Rules:

\* Trend trades often:  
  \* Clear \*\*internal liquidity\*\* (e.g. local equal lows) then continue.  
\* Reversals often:  
  \* Clear \*\*external liquidity\*\* (major swing high/low) at HTF S/R and then reverse.

\#\#\# 8.5 Interaction with other components

\* \*\*S/R\*\*:  
  \* Liquidity clusters usually sit around/just beyond S/R.  
  \* S/R \+ equal highs/lows \= \*\*very strong magnet\*\*.

\* \*\*Supply & Demand\*\*:  
  \* Demand below equal lows / supply above equal highs creates \*\*“sweep into zone”\*\* setups.

\* \*\*Structural Frameworks\*\*:  
  \* Heads in H\&S / inverse H\&S often sweep or sit near major liquidity magnets.

\* \*\*Fibonacci\*\*:  
  \* Liquidity sweeps that also tag the \*\*golden pocket or extension band\*\* are prime entry or TP zones.

\---

\#\# 9\. Liquidity flows

\#\#\# 9.1 Definition

“\*\*Liquidity flows\*\*” describe \*\*how price moves from one liquidity pool to another\*\*, driven by algorithms that:

\* Grab liquidity (stop runs).  
\* Then move price in the \*\*desired direction\*\* (trend or reversal).

\#\#\# 9.2 Reading path of least resistance

Core principles:

1\. \*\*Breakaway candles & BOS\*\* show intention.  
   \* Strong impulsive move \+ BOS suggests price wants to \*\*continue\*\* in that direction, after a corrective pullback.

2\. \*\*Failed expansions\*\*:  
   \* If price attempts to break a level but \*\*fails\*\* (no sustained breakaway candle), it often:  
     \* Returns back into the prior range.  
     \* Targets the \*\*opposite side’s liquidity\*\* (e.g. prior lows).

3\. \*\*Targeting liquidity zones\*\*:  
   \* After BOS up:  
     \* Pullback often runs to the \*\*last higher low / origin OB\*\* that fuelled the move.  
   \* After BOS down:  
     \* Pullback targets the \*\*last lower high / supply zone\*\*.

\#\#\# 9.3 Rules for anticipating stop hunts / liquidity grabs

\* In an \*\*uptrend\*\*:  
  \* Expect price to:  
    \* Sweep \*\*equal lows / prior daily lows\*\* inside the trend.  
    \* Tap demand/golden pocket.  
    \* Then continue up to take \*\*equal highs / prior highs\*\*.

\* In a \*\*downtrend\*\*:  
  \* Expect sweeps of \*\*equal highs / prior highs\*\* into supply, then continuation down.

\* At \*\*HTF turning points\*\*:  
  \* Look for:  
    \* Sweep of \*\*external liquidity\*\* (major swing high/low).  
    \* Immediate strong breakaway candle in opposite direction (early reversal).

\#\#\# 9.4 Using liquidity flows for decisions

Liquidity flows influence:

\* \*\*Directional bias\*\*:  
  \* After a strong BOS and successful retest, expect trend continuation toward the next \*\*major liquidity pool\*\* in trend direction.

\* \*\*Entry timing\*\*:  
  \* Wait for price to \*\*grab liquidity first\*\*, then confirm with structure/candles:  
    \* e.g. sweep below equal lows into demand and golden pocket → then 4H CHOCH/BOS.

\* \*\*Holding / scaling / exiting\*\*:  
  \* Hold trades \*\*until the next significant liquidity pool is approached\*\*.  
  \* Consider partial TP \*\*just before\*\* major pools (e.g. equal highs).  
  \* If liquidity behaviour is opposite what was expected (e.g. price keeps failing to move away after a sweep), consider reducing exposure or exiting.

\#\# 10\. HTF bias calculation

\#\#\# 10.1 Step-by-step

1\. \*\*Monthly\*\*  
   \* Identify macro trend (HH/HL or LH/LL).  
   \* Mark:  
     \* Nearest \*\*Monthly S/R\*\* above and below.  
     \* Major swing highs/lows & equal highs/lows.  
   \* Note if price is:  
     \* In the \*\*upper half / lower half\*\* of the range between major Monthly levels.  
     \* Just reacting to a Monthly zone.

2\. \*\*Weekly\*\*  
   \* Determine \*\*primary trend\*\*:  
     \* Sequence of HH/HL → bullish.  
     \* Sequence of LH/LL → bearish.  
   \* Identify:  
     \* Latest BOS.  
     \* Any forming/formed H\&S / inverse H\&S.  
     \* Weekly order blocks at Monthly S/R.  
   \* Define \*\*Weekly bias\*\*:  
     \* Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral.

3\. \*\*Daily\*\*  
   \* Within weekly bias:  
     \* Classify daily as:  
       \* \*\*Impulse leg\*\* in direction of weekly.  
       \* \*\*Corrective leg\*\* against weekly.  
   \* Find daily:  
     \* Supply/demand zones.  
     \* Liquidity magnets (prior day highs/lows, equal H/L).  
   \* Daily bias:  
     \* With weekly → \*\*strong bias\*\*.  
     \* Against weekly → \*\*correction\*\*, not new trend unless:  
       \* At major HTF level.  
       \* With strong reversal framework.

\#\#\# 10.2 Conflict resolution

\* \*\*Weekly up, Daily down\*\*:  
  \* Interpret daily down move as \*\*correction\*\* unless:  
    \* At major HTF resistance with H\&S / reversal signalling top.  
  \* Look for \*\*longs\*\* at:  
    \* Daily demand.  
    \* HTF support.  
    \* Golden pocket retracements.

\* \*\*Weekly down, Daily up\*\*:  
  \* Interpret daily up as correction.  
  \* Look for \*\*shorts\*\* at daily supply \+ HTF resistance.

\* \*\*Opposite trends without HTF level involvement\*\*:  
  \* Stand aside until:  
    \* Daily aligns back with Weekly \*\*OR\*\*  
    \* A clear reversal is confirmed at a major HTF zone.

\#\#\# 10.3 When to long / short / stand aside

\* \*\*Only longs\*\*:  
  \* Weekly bias \*\*bullish\*\*.  
  \* Daily:  
    \* Either impulsing up OR  
    \* In pullback near \*\*support \+ demand \+ fib \+ liquidity confluence\*\*.

\* \*\*Only shorts\*\*:  
  \* Weekly bias \*\*bearish\*\*.  
  \* Daily impulsing down or pulling back into \*\*resistance \+ supply \+ fib \+ liquidity\*\*.

\* \*\*Stand aside\*\*:  
  \* Weekly/Daily strongly \*\*conflicting\*\* with no clear HTF level.  
  \* In the \*\*middle of a wide range\*\* with no structure or liquidity edge.  
  \* Immediately after big news if structure is chaotic (implementation decision).

\---

\#\# 11\. 4H confirmation logic

\#\#\# 11.1 Role of 4H

4H is used to:

\* Confirm that \*\*HTF idea is being respected\*\*.  
\* Provide a \*\*tighter, technically justified entry\*\*.  
\* Avoid entering blindly at HTF levels.

\#\#\# 11.2 Required 4H signals

Typical confirmation patterns:

\* \*\*CHOCH/BOS\*\*:  
  \* After price enters HTF zone and sweeps liquidity:  
    \* Long: 4H breaks above a prior LH (local down leg) with a bullish candle.  
    \* Short: 4H breaks below a prior HL with a bearish candle.

\* \*\*Framework completion\*\*:  
  \* Mini H\&S / inverse H\&S / N/V patterns visible on 4H inside the HTF zone.

\* \*\*Candle patterns\*\* (secondary, not standalone):  
  \* Strong engulfing candle rejecting the zone.  
  \* Long lower wick at demand / long upper wick at supply.

\#\#\# 11.3 Interaction with HTF elements

\* \*\*Daily frameworks\*\*:  
  \* If daily shows a larger H\&S/inverse H\&S:  
    \* 4H should align by:  
      \* Giving the \*\*entry trigger\*\* at neckline retest.  
      \* Confirming the shoulder via BOS.

\* \*\*Supply & Demand\*\*:  
  \* 4H can refine the \*\*exact part of the daily zone\*\* to trade:  
    \* E.g., find a 4H OB nested inside the daily OB.

\* \*\*Liquidity flows\*\*:  
  \* Prefer:  
    \* 4H sweeps of \*\*previous day’s high/low\*\* or local equal H/L.  
    \* Then immediate BOS in direction of trade.

\* \*\*HTF bias\*\*:  
  \* A 4H signal \*\*against\*\* HTF bias is ignored unless:  
    \* It is the \*\*first sign of an HTF reversal at a major level\*\* and you explicitly choose to trade that reversal setup.

\#\# 12\. Entry criteria

\#\#\# 12.1 LONG setup checklist

A \*\*valid LONG\*\* must satisfy \*\*all\*\* of:

1\. \*\*HTF bias\*\*  
   \* Weekly bias bullish, or  
   \* Weekly neutral but at strong Monthly support with clear bullish framework.

2\. \*\*Location\*\*  
   \* Price is at or near:  
     \* Monthly/Weekly \*\*support S/R\*\*, and  
     \* A \*\*daily demand / order block\*\*, and  
     \* A \*\*Fibonacci retracement\*\* (0.618–0.796) of a meaningful impulsive leg.

3\. \*\*Market structure\*\*  
   \* On Daily:  
     \* Either HL sequence is intact \*\*or\*\*  
     \* A CHOCH/BOS up forming at HTF support.  
   \* No recent strong BOS down \*\*through\*\* key support.

4\. \*\*Structural framework (if present)\*\*  
   \* Inverse H\&S or Bullish N forming at the HTF level.  
   \* Not mandatory but increases conviction.

5\. \*\*Liquidity\*\*  
   \* Ideally:  
     \* A \*\*liquidity grab\*\* below equal lows / previous lows into the zone.  
     \* Or a sweep of previous week/day low.

6\. \*\*4H confirmation\*\*  
   \* Price taps HTF zone, then:  
     \* Prints a \*\*bullish engulfing\*\* or  
     \* 4H \*\*CHOCH/BOS up\*\* (break of minor LH).  
   \* No immediate strong rejection back into the zone after the signal.

7\. \*\*Risk/Reward\*\*  
   \* Stop can be placed logically below zone/lows.  
   \* Initial target (e.g. \*\*−0.25\*\* extension / prior high) offers at least \*\*2R+\*\*.

\#\#\# 17.3 Liquidity patterns

\#\#\#\# 17.3.1 Liquidity Grab Continuation (Bearish)

\*\*Context\*\*

\* Weekly \+ Daily \*\*bearish structure\*\* (LH/LL).  
\* Price is in a pullback phase within the downtrend.

\*\*Scenario\*\*

1\. \*\*Liquidity grab at highs\*\*  
   \* Daily forms \*\*equal highs\*\* or clusters of highs.  
   \* Price pushes above these highs:  
     \* Sweeping liquidity (stop hunts).  
     \* Forming wicks into a \*\*daily supply/OB\*\* at HTF resistance.

2\. \*\*Failure to break higher\*\*  
   \* Despite sweep, there is \*\*no clean BOS up\*\*.  
   \* Instead, structure stalls and forms a \*\*bearish order block\*\* at the highs.

3\. \*\*Fib & extension targets\*\*  
   \* Draw Fib from prior down swing:  
     \* From last LH high (body) to LL low (wick).  
   \* Supply aligns with \*\*0.618–0.796\*\* retracement.  
   \* Future targets set via extension ladder:  
     \* −0.25 → −0.68 → −1.00 → −1.42 → −2.00.

4\. \*\*4H confirmation\*\*  
   \* 4H shows:  
     \* BOS down (break of local HL) after the sweep.  
     \* Bearish engulfing or mini H\&S at the highs.

\*\*Entry\*\*

\* Short after 4H BOS from the bearish OB at the highs.

\*\*Stop\*\*

\* Above swept highs and OB wick.

\*\*Targets\*\*

\* TP1: next Daily demand zone or prior swing low.  
\* TP2: \*\*−0.25\*\* extension.  
\* Further TPs: −0.68, −1.00, −1.42, −2.00 as trend persists.
