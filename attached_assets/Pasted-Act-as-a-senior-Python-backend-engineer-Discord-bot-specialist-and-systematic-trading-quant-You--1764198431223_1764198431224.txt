Act as a senior Python backend engineer, Discord bot specialist, and systematic trading quant.

You are reviewing and testing my Discord trading bot:

GitHub repo: https://github.com/TheTradrBot/Blueprint-Tradr-AI-Bot

Your job now is to:

1. Load the entire project and understand:
   - All current features and slash commands.
   - How the live strategy logic, autoscan, and backtest are wired together.

2. Fully test the bot end-to-end:
   - Make sure all slash commands work as intended.
   - Make sure autoscan, live scans, active trade tracking, and backtesting all behave consistently with the same strategy logic.
   - If anything is not correct (live prices, entries, confluence rules, date ranges, backtest logic, signals, status flags, etc.), FIX IT directly in the code.

3. Check and validate backtests:
   - Run backtests for all configured assets over the full year 2024.
   - Use the actual strategy logic as implemented in the bot (same confluence, same signal rules).
   - Ensure the date parsing and data ranges are correct and not silently falling back to “last N candles”.
   - After fixing anything that’s wrong, report:
     - Per-asset performance in 2024.
     - The final combined dollar profit for all assets together in 2024, clearly stating the assumptions (starting balance, risk per trade, etc.) taken from the code or config.

4. Add or verify proper debug and error handling:
   - Ensure there is a working `/debug` command that returns a short health/status summary of the bot.
   - Make sure the bot has solid error handling and doesn’t crash on bad data, API issues, or user input (especially for scans, autoscan, and backtests).
   - If debug or error handling is missing or weak, improve it.

5. Explain how to run this bot 24/7:
   - Give me practical options to keep this exact project running continuously (for example Replit or a small server).
   - For each option, briefly explain how I’d set it up for this repo and how to keep tokens/keys safe.
   - Make sure whatever you propose fits this codebase without needing a full rewrite.

Important:
- If you change any file, output the full updated file (from the first line to the last line) so I can copy-paste it directly.
- After all fixes and tests, give me a clear summary:
  - What was broken or inconsistent (if anything).
  - What you changed to fix it.
  - The final validated 2024 backtest results and total dollar profit across all assets.
